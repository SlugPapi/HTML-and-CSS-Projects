			<h1>DUNCAN</h1>
				<p> &nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold">Duncan</span> was the cat I chose for my girlfriend. He is an adorable goober and is kind of stupid.<br>
				He constantly falls off of things and used to run headfirst into things as well. He is a big boi...<br>
				like massive compared to the others. He is a mostly black cat, tho there are a few small bits with some<br>
				white/grey fur, on his belly and his ears. Duncan is a good boy who love his cuddles :)</p>
